# File organization and Git configuration of this project
This project has been organized to allow code edits here on Github and on OP13 LL's laptop; edits in either of these locations are pushed to two remotes (this Github plus `L:/OPENTRONS/scripts`). The bottom line here is this: *only* edit code here on Github or on OP13 LL's personal device. *Do not edit the code in the L drive; changes made there will not be saved.*

### Git configuration
- Local for edits exists in `C:/Users/lucy/opentrons/opentrons` </br>
- Remote for edits/file viewing (fetch and push) exists at `github.com/aldatubio/opentrons.git` </br>
- Remote for file viewing (push) exists in `//10.225.40.23/lab/OPENTRONS/scripts/.git`
